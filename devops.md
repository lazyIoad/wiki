# DevOps

In my prior internship at Stripe, I worked primarily in a DevOps role, and found it a lot more fun to manage our AWS fleet than other roles handling mundane business logic. In my current job, I'm back to the business logic again, although I would love to go back and try it out again on maybe a small scale personal project.
