# Programming Languages

I've always found the wide variety of available programming languages to be both one of the best and worst parts of modern computer science. With the broad selection, it's easy to get caught up in analysis paralysis, but I'd love to spend some more time trying to play around and discover what I like with each.

Historically, I've worked with and been taught primiarly objected oriented languages, but am trying to experiment with more functional ones.
