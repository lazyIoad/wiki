# Go

After several years of using Express of Koa for personal project backends, I've become weary of all the setup required to get a project going \(even moreso with Typescript\), and the ridiculous number of libraries and dependencies needed for every project. Go seems like a great drop-in replacement with a fantastic stdlib and static typing.

I'm not the biggest fan of its syntax, and rather think it looks quite ugly, but from my experiences with it, its very utilitarian and fast to get started with.
