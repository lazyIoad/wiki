# Backups

I've fiddled with a few different backup setups, but none really striked the balance of performance, open source-ness, and low battery impact that I was looking for. Prior to my most recent setup, I was using Arq to backup to Backblaze B2, and nearly continued using it after upgrading my personal Macbook Pro. However, after reading [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arqbackup/comments/fxt2j3/arq_6_help_needed_i_honestly_have_no_idea_what_to/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArqBackup_Community/comments/gk0eym/arq_6_restore_testing_not_real_good/) about major issues with the newest release of Arq, I decided to reevaluate options and ended up choosing [duplicacy](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy) backed up to B2. 

The CLI is free and the program is open source, and the results have been phenomenal so far, to the extent that I should probably pay for the program just to support its creator. I use [launchd](https://www.launchd.info/) on my Mac to automatically run a python script that backs up the directories I've selected every evening. The configuration is all available on my [Github](https://github.com/lazyIoad/dotfiles/tree/master/backup).

Backups on my phone are a bit trickier. Once in a while I'll hook up my iPhone to my Mac and manually perform a backup, but it's rather rare. I don't care much for the application data or settings, as most of those are saved already, but I don't have a perfect solution for my photos just yet. In the past, I tried using a self-hosted Nextcloud instance, but its mobile client was pretty finnicky and would usually crash while trying to perform the initial backup. Google Photos works like a charm and generally has every feature I could want, but I've migrated off of it since trying to de-Google my life. Currently, I'm using OneDrive as I get an Office 365 subscription with 1 TB of space at a steeply discounted rate, but I'm not happy with the client either, and I'm not sure if it correctly saves my live photos. In the future, I may just opt to pay for an iCloud subscription for the seamless syncing of my photo library.
