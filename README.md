# hall of the mountain king

Hi. This is my little corner where I'll try to compile various learnings and links that I come across, both for my own reference and maybe even that of anyone that happens by.

This project is very directly inspired by Nikita Voloboev's [vast wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/). If I find myself using this a lot more than I currently project, I hope to move it off Gitbook and maybe use some self-hosted and even self-built system instead.

The name of the site and this page specifically refer to a scene in [Kentucky Route Zero](https://kentuckyroutezero.com/), my favorite video game and work of art, which was in turn inspired by [Project Xanadu](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/). I find the name apt.
